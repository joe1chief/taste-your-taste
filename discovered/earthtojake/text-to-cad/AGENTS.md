# AGENTS.md

Installing text-to-cad rather than developing it? Follow the Install section of
[README.md](README.md).

This repo is a workbench for CAD-related agent skills. Treat `skills/` as the
product and `models/` as the shared fixture/artifact area.

## Branch First

`main` is the only branch you develop on: the source tree, and what releases
are cut from. Branch from `main` and open PRs against `main`; never push it
directly. There is no development symlink layout — every path in the tree is the
real file. Installers follow `latest`, and claude.ai's directory
`claude-plugin`: the plugin alone, one commit per release,
written only by `Publish Release` once the release is on PyPI (see below); never
commit to them. `main` stays an installable plugin too: every manifest and MCP
config lives at its root.

## Release Workflow

A pull request that changes `VERSION` is a release, and merging it releases it.
Never bump during normal development work, and never pick the bump yourself: if
a request to make or ship a release does not name patch, minor, major, or an
exact version, ask which one. A release pull request comes one of two ways:

- **Its own pull request**, for a release of what `main` already has — what
  "make a release" means unless the user names a pull request to carry it:
  dispatch `Prepare Release`
  (`gh workflow run release-prepare.yml --ref main -f bump=<patch|minor|major>`,
  or `-f set_version=X.Y.Z`). It opens `release/X.Y.Z` with the bump and never
  merges it.
- **On the pull request that should carry it**: on its branch,
  `scripts/release/bump-version.sh <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>` sets `VERSION` past
  `main`'s and stamps the derived metadata and every `cadgen==` pin with it.

Merge a release pull request only on the user's explicit word, once its checks
pass: the merge is the release.

- `Test` runs every job for a `VERSION` change, so a release is tested whole.
  Its Version Check vets the bump: a branch of this repository only (a fork
  cannot release), a version past `main`'s and the latest tag, every stamp in
  step.
- `Publish Release` (`release-publish.yml`) runs on the merge. It finds the
  `Test` run that recorded the merged tree as tested in full (else it runs every
  `Test` job on it first), builds the plugin ZIP, the bundle and the `cadgen`
  wheel and sdist, installs and exercises the wheel, uploads it to PyPI, and
  waits until PyPI's index lists it. Only then does it commit the plugin alone
  onto the branches installers follow (`scripts/release/plugin_branch.py`):
  `latest`, which every install command names, and `claude-plugin`, which
  claude.ai's directory tracks. After them it deploys the docs site, which moves
  the version feed, and tags (`v<VERSION>`; releases before 0.5.0 are bare
  `0.4.x` tags) and GitHub-Releases the release commit, with the wheel and sdist
  that went to PyPI attached as release assets, plus the plugin ZIP that a
  person uploads to OpenAI's plugin portal, which has no API.

To finish a run that stopped partway, dispatch `Publish Release` on `main`
(`publish=false` leaves the GitHub Release as a draft): it publishes the commit
that last moved `VERSION`, if that version has no tag yet. `build-test` is the
rehearsal branch — `Prepare Release` with `-f target=build-test` opens a bump
against it, whose merge is built and installed with no PyPI, branches, docs or
tag — and is never a release; use it only when the user explicitly asks to test
the pipeline.

The standalone `Deploy Docs` workflow redeploys the docs site from a ref
(default `main`, or a release tag) without running a release.

cadgen runs as ONE launch command everywhere, `uvx --no-config --managed-python
--python 3.13 --from cadgen==<VERSION> <tool>` (`cadgen._internal.launch`): the
plugin server configs and every cadgen skill's SKILL.md carry it, the release
stamps every pin (`sync-version.mjs`), and `scripts/release/check-version.sh`
and the tests assert they all equal `VERSION`. uv keeps one installation per
requirement and cadgen names its warm daemon after that installation, so the
server, every thread and every skill command share one daemon. In a checkout,
install `requirements-dev.txt` (the editable cadgen) and test in agent apps with
`scripts/install/dev_install.py`, which points both at the checkout.
`models/` stays on `main` as plain files; nothing installs it.
`scripts/github-workflows/check-builds.sh` enforces the shipping contract on
every push: no tracked symlink, no `.gitattributes` rule that rewrites files at
checkout or changes the archive (so no Git LFS; claude.ai's plugin directory
refuses them), every tracked file under 5 MiB, no skill reaching into a repo root.
See the Releases section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full flow, the resume
path, the rehearsal, and local/manual fallbacks.

## Repo Map

- `skills/`: agent skills and their references/scripts.
- `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `gemini-extension.json`:
  agent plugin manifests. The repository root is the plugin package; its skills are
  `skills/` directly. Installers take it from the `latest` branch, which
  `scripts/release/plugin_branch.py` builds from this tree at each release.
- `models/`: sample and durable CAD/robot-description fixtures.
- `apps/web/`: the CAD Viewer's React client (its backend is `cadgen.viewer`).
- `apps/mcp/`: the CAD app agent hosts render: tabs in Codex, cards in Claude Desktop (its server is `cadgen mcp`).
- `packages/core`: `@text-to-cad/core`, shared CAD/runtime/client code without React.
- `packages/ui`: `@text-to-cad/ui`, the shared FileViewer, renderers, controls and styles.
- `packages/cadgen`: the published distribution — STEP/GLB/topology generation,
  the skill CLI parsers, the CAD Viewer backend + client, and the Node/browser
  runtimes it executes.
- `apps/docs/`: documentation site, and `api.texttocad.dev` (cadgen's version feed and the CAD app's consented analytics).
- `tests/`: root-owned test suites for skills, packages, viewer services, and
  repo-wide policy.
- `scripts/`: durable repo commands grouped by purpose.

## Repo Rules

- Boundaries and design laws live in each package's README: read
  `packages/cadgen/README.md` (the laws), `packages/core/README.md`, `packages/ui/README.md`,
  `apps/web/README.md`, and `apps/docs/README.md` before changing
  generation, rendering, storage, layout, or public interfaces.
- A README holds the laws; the mechanism each law constrains lives one link
  away, and the README names the link. Read the README, then follow the one
  link — not the tree. What exists:
  - `packages/cadgen/`: `STORE.md` (the store contract — sectioned, with a
    table of contents), `SNAPSHOTS.md` (snapshot `--debug` timings).
  - `packages/core/docs/`: `render-pipeline.md`, `resource-ownership.md`,
    `tube-deformation.md`.
  - `packages/ui/docs/`: `settings-ui.md` (BINDING for any settings control),
    `render-types.md`, `render-mode.md`, `lod.md`, `storage.md`, `backend.md`.
- Ships-alone law: `packages/cadgen` (the built PyPI wheel) works in isolation
  outside this repo, so its markdown must not refer to anything outside the
  package — enforced by `tests/python/global/test_package_boundaries.py`.
  Repo-development guidance for it goes in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- The README and the docs site's homepage (its copy: `apps/docs/src/lib/content.ts`)
  share their structure, install message and commands: change them together.
  The README says more: the steps to install it yourself, and fuller notes under each install
  (`apps/docs/README.md`).
- Keep root guidance short. Put domain workflows, CLI details, and validation
  policy in the relevant `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` or `references/` file.
- Keep relevant Markdown docs current when changing behavior, commands, or repo
  layout, but do not bloat `AGENTS.md`; use it only for durable repo-level
  rules and pointers.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before committing, rebasing, resolving generated-file
  conflicts, or bumping release versions.
- A skill must not import another skill, a `skills/` root module, or a
  repository-root module, and must not add `skills/`, the repository root, or a
  sibling skill directory to `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, `NODE_PATH`, or any other
  runtime lookup path. Skills are independent of each other, not of everything.
- Shared runtime comes from the **`cadgen` distribution**. A skill that uses it
  defines `cadgen` and `python` in its SKILL.md as the launch command above,
  pinned to `VERSION` (the release stamps every pin); no skill installs cadgen
  any other way (no `requirements.txt` naming it), because a second installation
  is a second daemon. Skills do not vendor it: a skill script is a thin entrypoint whose
  parser and behaviour live in `cadgen.cli`. Playwright is a cadgen dependency and
  the first snapshot fetches its headless browser, so no skill has a browser step. cadgen carries
  the JavaScript it executes too (Node builders, the snapshot browser bundle,
  the CAD Viewer client), so a skill ships no runtime of its own. Not every
  skill needs cadgen (bambu-labs, dfam-check, dfm, gcode, sendcutsend,
  step-parts are cadgen-free); do not add the dependency to a skill that never invokes it.
- Keep samples and manual CAD/robot-description validation artifacts under
  `models/`. Automated tests must not read, build or import that sample corpus:
  generate small fixtures in fresh temporary directories or use tiny test-owned
  fixtures, with their own cache stores and cleanup. Repo `tmp/` is fine.
  Enforced by `tests/python/global/test_tests_are_self_contained.py`.
- Every test runs in CI. Each test file is reached by a runner under
  `scripts/test/`, every runner is called by a `test.yml` job on the changes that
  can break it, and a collector that finds nothing fails the run rather than
  reporting a group that never ran. A test no CI job runs is dead: wire it in or
  delete it. There are no manual-only test gates. Enforced by
  `tests/python/global/test_ci_workspace_selection.py`.
- Tests and CI are short and succinct. Test a contract, a user flow or a fixed bug,
  once, at the cheapest level that exercises the real path: a unit or jsdom test
  first, a real browser (WebGL) only for what needs one. Await the condition, never
  a fixed sleep or a wall-clock bound; a flaky test is fixed or deleted, never
  retried. CI time is a budget: the `web` job stays within 7 minutes, and a
  change that lengthens any job says what it costs and why in its PR.
- Benchmarks under `scripts/bench/` are manual and their output is never
  committed: reports, logs, profiles and screenshots go to an ignored `tmp/`.
  Only their pure helper units run in a test runner.
- The Python floor is `requires-python` in `packages/cadgen/pyproject.toml` and
  nowhere else. Every cadgen source is parsed against that floor, so syntax
  newer than it fails here rather than at `pip install` time on a user's
  interpreter; raising the declared minimum relaxes the check automatically.
- Reserve `scripts/` for durable repo commands. Do not write temporary,
  one-off, or local-only helper scripts there; use `tmp/` or `/tmp` instead.
- cadgen's packaged runtime (`_runtime/node`, `_runtime/browser`,
  `_runtime/viewer`, and the file tracer every build loads, `_runtime/native`)
  is BUILT, never committed: the whole directory is
  gitignored and ships only inside the wheel. Build it with the one bundle
  entry point, `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`; `bundle.sh --check` builds it and
  asserts every required output. Call `scripts/bundle/cadgen-runtime.sh`
  directly only when debugging one stage.
- Installs always work from `main`. A command that names no branch installs `main`
  as it is, so every manifest, MCP config and the marketplace catalog stay at its
  root, the catalog lists the plugin at `./`, and nothing on `main` points an
  installer at another branch. The documented commands name `latest` instead: the
  plugin alone, one commit per release, which `Publish Release` writes once the
  release is on PyPI, so it installs lean (no monorepo, no npm install of the
  workspace) and is never ahead of PyPI. `latest` is a channel, so a slower
  `stable` can join it later. `tests/python/global/test_plugin_manifests.py`
  holds both halves.
- Never let a symlink reach the published tree. Agent installers disagree about
  symlinks and one loses data silently: the Skills CLI dereferences them, Claude
  Code preserves them, and Codex `plugin add` drops them with no error, shipping
  a skill with missing files. `scripts/github-workflows/check-builds.sh` enforces
  this; do not relax it.
- The CAD Viewer is `cadgen viewer`: the server is `cadgen.viewer` (Python, in
  `packages/cadgen`), the React client's source is `apps/web/` and its build
  ships in the wheel at `cadgen/_runtime/viewer` (built, never committed; a
  checkout serves `apps/web/dist`). The CAD, DXF and robot-description skills document that verb directly.
  Nothing in `cadgen.viewer` imports the CAD kernel at module scope — the one
  kernel action, importing a foreign STEP, is a compile job in cadgen's build
  pool, never work the server process does.
  Keep repo-level tooling in `scripts/`, not under `apps/web/`.
- `packages/core` stays non-React. Shared FileViewer/renderers belong in
  `packages/ui`; host workflow state belongs in apps. Apps never import another
  app and shared packages never import apps. Root npm workspaces consume compiled
  package exports; do not add source aliases or nested lockfiles. Preserve app
  UI/UX and functionality during restructuring; changes are pure refactors.
- Shared UI must stay platform-agnostic. Apps implement environmental effects;
  shared features use injected capabilities and named extension slots. Before
  extending these interfaces, read [the viewer host contract](packages/ui/docs/viewer-host.md).
- `packages/cadgen` is the whole distribution, not just the Python: artifact
  generation, the CLI parsers behind every skill command (`cadgen/cli`), the warm
  build daemon (`cadgen/daemon`), and
  the JS/SPA assets it executes (`cadgen/_runtime`, built by
  `scripts/bundle/cadgen-runtime.sh`). Skills consume it as an
  installed distribution.
- Create lightweight shared Python packages under `packages/` when a helper
  should not inherit heavier package dependencies.
- Use path-targeted search, validation, and `git status`; avoid broad scans over
  generated CAD artifacts unless the task requires them.
- Treat `VERSION` as the canonical release version. Do not hand-edit duplicate
  package, plugin, lockfile, or Python `pyproject.toml` versions;
  `scripts/release/bump-version.sh` and `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh` stamp them
  from the canonical version.

## Environments

- Prefer `./.venv/bin/python` for CAD Python work.
- Keep new branch checkouts and git worktrees lightweight by default. Do not
  copy `.venv/` or `models/` through `.worktreeinclude`; recreate `.venv/`
  inside the worktree only when Python dependencies are needed for the workflow.
- In Codex or Claude Code worktrees, prefer the skill instructions and scripts
  under the current worktree's `skills/` directory over globally installed
  skills or plugins from another checkout.
- Test skills and the plugin in an agent app with
  `scripts/install/dev_install.py <host>` (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, "Test In Agent
  Apps"). One copy of the plugin per app: never the development install beside
  the published plugin, or beside the skills installed loose.
- Install dependencies only for the workflow being changed.
- Do not commit `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, caches, `tmp/`, local credentials, or
  printer config.

## Checks

Run the smallest path-targeted check that covers the change. Use broad wrappers
when touching shared surfaces or before handoff:

- Code tests: `scripts/test/test.sh` (JS, then Python, then policy).
- Focused runners: `scripts/test/test-js.sh`, `scripts/test/test-docs.sh`,
  `scripts/test/test-python.sh`, `scripts/test/test-global.sh`.
  `test-python.sh` takes `--select cadgen|viewer|skills|all` and
  `--print-weights`; `test-js.sh` takes `--select core|ui|web|mcp|all`. See
  `scripts/README.md`.
- In GitHub Actions, `test.yml` runs one job per concern, each only when the
  change reaches it: `scripts/github-workflows/select_checks.py` maps every
  changed path to the tests that read it, and the Python jobs run just those
  files. A test that reads a new kind of path gets a rule there
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md#ci`); an unknown path, `VERSION`, `packages/core`, the
  lockfiles and the test machinery run everything, as does a manual dispatch.
  Required check names stay stable.
- Canonical release version: `scripts/release/check-version.sh`
- Packaged runtime builds and is complete: `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check`
- CAD Viewer or shared packages: build exports with `npm run build:packages`,
  then `npm --prefix packages/core test`, `npm --prefix packages/ui test`,
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test`, `npm --prefix apps/web run build`.
  The Viewer is two languages and `npm run test` covers only the client — the
  backend's suite is `tests/python/packages/cadgen/viewer`, run by
  `scripts/test/test-python.sh`. Touching `cadgen/viewer/` means running that.
- Docs site: `npm --prefix apps/docs run check`
- Targeted Python tests: `./.venv/bin/python -m unittest <changed test paths>`

When a task changes what the bundlers consume, run `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`
and confirm the change lands in the built runtime. There is nothing to commit:
`_runtime/` is gitignored end to end, so what a reviewer reads is the source and
what a user gets is the wheel the release builds from it.

## CAD Viewer

The app-facing playbook lives in `apps/web/README.md`: launcher contract
(reuse, ports, `--new`), dev vs prod, and the catalog/link-verification
gotchas. The repo-side half — the lightweight-worktree recipe and
root workspace dependencies — lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md` under "Viewer Development
In This Repo". Read them before starting, stopping, or debugging a Viewer.
Never stop an instance you did not start; packaged-runtime checks go
through `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh`.

## Git

No Git LFS, and every file under 5 MiB: the repository root is the plugin, and
claude.ai's plugin directory refuses files a filter rewrites at checkout, so
heavyweight media stays out of the tree. Local hooks live in `.githooks` and
delegate build checks through `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`.
